This is a note for my own recollection of the important topics in the mooc-fi coures: DevOps with Docker. The note will contain impoertant commands and reflections on those
on the commands. This will help me to understand the concepts better.
### What's a Docker Image? ###

Image is a file. It is built according to an instruction file called Dockerfile. An image never changes; you can not edit an existing file, but you can create a new **layer** to it.

### What's a Docker Container? ###

Containers only contain that which is required to execute an application; and you can start, stop and interact with them. They are **isolated** environments in the host machine with the ability to interact with each other and the host machine itself via defined methods (TCP/UDP).

### Image vs container ###

Containers are instances of images.

Cooking metaphor:
* Dockerfile is the shopping list (& recipe).
* Image is the ingredients.
* Container is the delicious treat.

1. To get an image, you have to build it with the Dockerfile.
2. You then run the image creating a container.

So, perhaps an even more fitting metaphor would be that the image is a frozen, pre-cooked meal.

To get a docker image and create an instance of the image, run the command: `docker run hello-world` from the command line
